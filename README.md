#Pickme

A web page implementation of the pickme PHP script. Given a Meetup event ID and an API key, the program will retrieve the list of "Yes" RSVP's and randomly pick one. This replaces other methods of randomly drawing winners from attendees at meet up events.

Possible future improvements:
* Save meeting ID and API key to reuse and rerun quickly.
